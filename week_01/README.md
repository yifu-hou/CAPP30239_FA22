# H3 Self Introduction

Hi! This is my data selfie. 

As you can read according to the instructions (https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-draw-your-own-selfie-using-your-personal-data/), I'm 23, born in Asia (a small town in the North of China to be exact) and now living in America (Chicago, IL). I tend to describe myself as pessimistic (or you can say my cup is half-empty). I'm 100% a night owl and my sleep schedule is usually from 2 am to 9 am. I don't sing in the shower but I do like playing songs and mouthing the lyrics. I always know I'm a dog person even though I don't own any pet. My iPhone is always within arm reach otherwise I'll be anxious. I use both pen (for better writing) and pensil (for more organized notes). I am an introvert with a bit of extrovert social needs. Maybe that's why I always spend my weekends on "adventures", aka going out with my best freinds. If I'm going on vacation, I will bring 3 other friends because we could hang out in pairs. It's also less awkward if two people had an argument. Given $100, I would save $50, spend $30 and give away $20. But later on I changed it to 50 : 40 : 10 because I realized I need more money.

For degree path, I was studying journalism and media before coming to MSCAPP program. I initially wanted to do data journalism and seek for positions such as data visualization specialist, but I'm also open to data scientist and machine learning specialist positions.
