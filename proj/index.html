        <h1>Chicago Weather in Visuals: Why Is It So Awful Here?</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Like many people coming to Chicago for the first time, I have been asking myself two questions: 
                “what am I doing here?” and “why is the winter so awful?” 
            </p>
            <p>
                While the first question would take a much longer time for me to find 
                an answer, the second one is easy: it's a combined result of humidity, wind, sunlight and temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like Lake Michigan, Metropolitan Chicago's topography is a product of glaciation. The geographical 
                feature exposes Chicago to the cold air in winter pushed all the way from Canada. The humidity is high and 
                the wind is strong all year round, but in winter those elements make people feel even colder. The cold, 
                windy weather, paired with short daytime and lack of sunlight, can really make the winter Chicago a bad place.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project explores the Chicago weather through data records. The three charts will break down the winter 
                weather in Chicago in relative to the weather in the rest of the year. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The historical weather data is collected from <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/">Visual Crossing 
                Weather Records</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="pt1">
            <h3>Feels colder? Because it does!</h3>

                <p>
                    There are many unpleasant aspects of Chicago winter. The most obvious one is the cold. The winter 
                    weather hits hard to your face like an ambush. And a lot of the time it seems to be colder than what 
                    the weather report says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because its true! Our body perceives temperature in a certain way. This is often described as feelslike 
                    temperature in daily communication. Sometimes it's referred as heat index or apparent temperature. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Chicago, the feelslike temperature is only slightly higher in summer (from June to September), and 
                    the average difference usually doesn't go up to one Fahrenheit degree. While for the rest of the year 
                    the feelslike temperature is significantly lower than air temperature, thanks to the wind and humidity. 
                    In January, this difference is seen to be the largest - the average feelslike temperature is lower by 
                    average air temperature by 9.29 Fahrenheit degrees. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: Feelslike temperature is a measurement to describe how human bodies perceive the temperature in a 
                    place with other factors, such as windchill and humidity. More detailed explanation on how it works:

                    Cold weather along isn't t so depressing, if it's companied with abundant sunlight. Unfortunately, 
                    Chicago only offers nice sunlight during the summertime. The wet, gloomy weather continues from November 
                    all the way to late spring. In 2021, there were 43 continuous days when Chicago only saw one day of sun. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is believed by many researchers that lack of Vitamin D relates to seasonal depression. And the change 
                    of amount of natural sunlight, combined with the infamous end of Daylight Saving Time in November, can 
                    cause a large reduction of sunlight exposure for Chicagoans. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In December, the “darkest” month of the year, the average daytime is only 9.15 hours. If you're not an 
                    early bird and get up at 10 am, you will likely only have 6 hours of sunlight. And that's on a good day 
                    when the sun decides to show up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By checking the average solar power received in Chicago, we can see that once in winter months, the solar 
                    power is halved, if not more, comparing with its peak in June (20.78 MJ/sqm).

                    <p>
                        Although the term Windy City was firstly referred to Chicago for political reasons, the city certainly 
                        did not fail to live up its stereotype for incomers. The flat geographical feature of Midwest is perfect 
                        for cold wind from the north, and the tall buildings in Chicago add a significant chimney effect to the 
                        wind, making it stronger in the city. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chicago is windy in every season, and in 2021 the average windspeed is at around 15 miles per hour. In 
                        the graph we can see some sharp spikes in winter months, where the windspeed exceeds 20 miles per hour 
                        on many days.

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <h5>Data:</h5>
        <p>
            I am interested in weather data because of a cool visualization I've seen in my project review homework. 
            In Tokyo, Japan some people visualized the delay of foliage peak following the delay of large daily temperature 
            difference in fall. I have never handled weather data before, and it seemed to be a great experience exploring 
            something I'm not so familiar with. 
        </p>
        <p>As one of the largest cities in America, Chicago kept a decent historical weather data since 1871. The data before 
            this was unfortunately destroyed by Great Chicago Fire. After that, many organizations have served as official 
            weather observation locations for the Chicago office, including the two airports - O'Hare and Midway, Chicago Opera 
            House, and the University of Chicago (from 1926 to 1942). The data for this project is collected from 
            <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/">Visual Crossing Weather Records</a>. 
            I chose Visual Crossing Weather Records because it is free and the data is already pretty clean. 
            It still takes a lot of effort to process the data until it fits the visual project. 
            The Python file pj_data.ipynb handles the data cleaning process. 
        </p>
        <p>The story follows different aspects of the weather data: temperature, sunlight and wind. I was inspired from the early 
            part of this course on data humanism that data visualization can be intimate and personal. So this visualization is very 
            much using objected data source to deliver my impressions of the Chicago weather. 
        </p>
        <p>There was no missing data because this project only includes weather data from the past 10 years, when there were enough 
            technical support to record and store data. The data is open sourced with a limited quota of daily free download.
        </p>
        <h5>Visualizing Process:</h5>
        <p>
            I started the project with the visualization for sunlight and daytime. The chart is designed based on the structure 
            of a regular scatter plot: with x axis aligning with time and y axis representing the length of daytime. The dot size 
            is added as the third dimension - which corresponds to the average monthly solar energy received. The large-sized dots 
            end up laying on a bell-shaped curve, almost similar to the track of the sun projected on earth. For simplicity, the 
            chart does not disclose the exact values for average daytime and the average solar energy received of the month. Instead, 
            a toolkit is implemented to present information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The temperature is the second chart implemented for the project. It was initially designed to be a scatter plot showing 
            two groups of temperature data: daily feelslike temperature and daily air temperature in the past ten years, where the 
            distance between the two points of a day is highlighted if large differences is found for one day. The original design 
            also includes an overlapped line chart for daily humidity. However, the challenge for this design is that even after 
            sampling the dataset, it is still too huge to visualize. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, the monthly average air temperature and the monthly average feelslike temperature is calculated based on 
            the weather data of the past 10 years. With which I calculated their difference. To my satisfaction they presented the 
            same key information. The chart for humidity is removed because it's stabled all year round and not seem to correlate 
            with the main chart, and I also want to avoid using two axes for one chart.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main challenge for this chart is the placement of negative values for bar chart. Unlike regular bar charts where 
            everything is appended naturally, bar charts with negative values really challenges one's understanding of how D3 works 
            to put layers of elements on a chart. A lot of time was spent on calculating the right positions and sizes for rectangle 
            objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wind chart took more time than the other two combined. Radius line chart is aesthetically pleasing and is a great 
            design for representing time series or a directional data. It can be viewed as a regular line chart, where x-axis is 
            curved into a circle and y-axis is shown by the radius. This chart was originally designed to be a radius line chart 
            showing the aggregated windspeed from 16 directions (N, NNE, NE, ENE, E, …), with an interactive function to display 
            different lines for 12 months. However, it seems that the D3 lineRadius doesn't support categorical values for x-axis. 
            So implemented the chart with data for windspeed in one year (2021) and used the continuous time data as x-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            This chart faced many challenges. Unlike other charts where D3 handles some heavy lifting for building axes and appending 
            shapes, radius line chart really demands every element of the chart to be built from scratch. So, the first steps are 
            creating circles and lines for the frame of the chart. Then, a d3.lineRadius element is appended to mark the daily 
            windspeed throughout the year of 2021. I used the same function for yearly average line. This process was very 
            time-consuming and there was a lot of changing idea. I also implemented a radius bar chart and tried to build the rose 
            wind map based on the code for pie chart, but neither of those were selected in the project.
