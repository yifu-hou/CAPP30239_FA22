    <h1>INVESTIGATING POLICE SHOT DEATH DATA</h1>
        
    <div id="bar">
        <h2>1 - Demographic Distribution of 2015 Police Shot Death</h2>
        <p>
        The chart presents the ethnicity distribution of people shot by police. 
        As the chart shows, the majority of the data are identified as white and black. 
        What's worth noticing is that even though the two groups takes up large proportion 
        of police shot death, they are very different when it comes to whether they were 
        armed with a gun or not (if time permits, a horizontal stacked bar chart should better 
        present this).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="time_line">
        <h2>2 - 2015 Police Shot Death by Time</h2>
        <p>
        This line chart shows the number of deaths from police shooting 
        in the year of 2015, with x-axis being the timeline and y-axis 
        represents the number of deaths.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="plot3">
        <h2>3 - 2015 Police Shot Death Age Distribution</h2>
        <p>
        This histogram shows the age distribution of deaths from police shooting 
        in the year of 2015. The whole area represents the total number of people 
        and the height of different bars represent the number of people belonging 
        to that age group.
